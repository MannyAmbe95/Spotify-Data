Power BI Data Analysis Project: Trends & Streaming Insights (1920 - 2030) ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“Š
This Power BI project explores a rich dataset spanning from 1920 to 2030, providing an in-depth look at trends in the art and music industry. The goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive understanding of data processing, from initial data cleansing to the creation of interactive visualizations that highlight key industry trends over time.

Project Overview
The dataset consists of historical and future-projected data on artists, streaming numbers, and other relevant industry metrics. The project required extensive data cleaning, transformation, and preparation before meaningful insights could be extracted. Using Power BIâ€™s robust set of tools, I applied a variety of basic and advanced data cleansing techniques to ensure accuracy and consistency.

After preprocessing the data, I leveraged Power BIâ€™s interactive visualization capabilities to build a dashboard that presents dynamic insights. The final dashboard includes multiple infographics and trend analysis components that allow users to explore data based on specific years and artists. These visual elements help uncover historical patterns, growth trends, and predictions for future developments in the industry.

Key Features

âœ… Data Cleansing & Transformation â€“ The project involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, removing duplicates, and performing other essential data preparation steps using Power Query. Advanced techniques such as data type conversions, text transformations, and calculated columns were also applied.

âœ… Dynamic Visualizations â€“ The dashboard features interactive charts, allowing users to filter data based on specific time periods and artists. This enhances user engagement and enables deeper analysis.

âœ… Trend Analysis â€“ The visual reports provide insights into how the music and art industry has evolved over the years. Trends in streaming, popularity, and artist influence can be explored through line graphs, bar charts, and other visuals.


Skills & Technologies Used
ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning & Preparation: Power Query, DAX, data transformation techniques
ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization: Interactive dashboards, dynamic charts, tooltips
ðŸ”¹ Trend Analysis & Forecasting: Time-series analysis, historical trends, future projections
ðŸ”¹ User Experience Enhancements: Filters, slicers, drill-through functionality

Why This Project Matters
This project serves as a practical demonstration of how Power BI can be used to transform raw data into meaningful insights. The ability to interact with the dataset, observe trends, and predict future movements makes this project a valuable resource for industry professionals, analysts, and enthusiasts alike.

Next Steps
I plan to further refine the dashboard by integrating additional datasets and enhancing the predictive analytics components. Future improvements may also include real-time data updates and AI-driven insights.
