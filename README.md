Power BI Data Analysis Project: Trends & Streaming Insights (1920 - 2030) ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“Š
This Power BI project explores a rich dataset spanning from 1920 to 2030, providing an in-depth look at trends in the music industry. The goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive understanding of data processing, from initial data cleansing to the creation of interactive visualizations that highlight key industry trends over time.

Project Overview
The dataset consists of historical data on artists, streaming numbers, and other relevant industry metrics. The project required extensive data cleaning, transformation, and preparation before meaningful insights could be extracted. Using Power BIâ€™s robust set of tools, I applied a variety of basic and advanced data cleansing techniques to ensure accuracy and consistency.

After preprocessing the data, I leveraged Power BIâ€™s interactive visualization capabilities to build a dashboard that presents dynamic insights. The final dashboard includes multiple infographics and trend analysis components that allow users to explore data based on specific years and artists. These visual elements help uncover historical patterns, growth trends, and predictions for future developments in the industry.

Key Features

âœ… Data Cleansing & Transformation â€“ The project involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, removing duplicates, and performing other essential data preparation steps using Power Query. Advanced techniques such as data type conversions, text transformations, and calculated columns were also applied.

âœ… Dynamic Visualizations â€“ The dashboard features interactive charts, allowing users to filter data based on specific time periods and artists. This enhances user engagement and enables deeper analysis.

âœ… Trend Analysis â€“ The visual reports provide insights into how the music and art industry has evolved over the years. Trends in streaming, popularity, and artist influence can be explored through line graphs, bar charts, and other visuals.


Skills & Technologies Used
ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning & Preparation: Power Query, DAX, data transformation techniques
ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization: Interactive dashboards, dynamic charts, tooltips
